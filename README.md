# Hangman_Python

The classic game of hangman (normally consisting of two players) for all ages, used to improve the the spelling skills of the speller. New and improved version now consists of one player, who shall be guessing the word.

The first iteration is the most simple and basic. User needs to input a letter and it wil conlcude whether it has been spelt right or wrong.

Iteration-2 is quite similar to the first one but now if statements are introduced.

The Third iteration is now the original hangman game with a certain number of guesses and everytime user inputs a wrong letter a certain limb of the hangman is added
